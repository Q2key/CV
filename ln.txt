[Paragraph 1. Why I love what I do]
I started my career path more than 8 years ago, beginning as a junior developer at RIT. Over time, I was involved in several projects in domain areas such as FinTech and DocTech. Although I’m currently working toward a Master’s Degree in Computer Science, I’m a self-taught developer and still have the same passion for my work. As a result, I’ve led several projects and grown into a senior position. I can proudly say that I still really love what I’m doing and take pride in my work.

[Paragraph 2. My professional story with positions and responsibilities]
At FastDev, I focus on building and optimizing Python services for data analysis, refactoring legacy systems, and improving SQL performance. I’ve taken the lead on team projects, made key architectural decisions, and significantly improved system scalability and performance through containerization and service migration to Go.
Previously, at Russian Informational Technologies, I developed Python services for document parsing and 3D rendering applications. As a Go developer, I contributed to backend features for mobile banking platforms and led technical teams. My work with NodeJS involved integrating crypto providers, building document generation services, and optimizing system performance. I’ve also worked extensively with C# and JavaScript, creating custom libraries and maintaining legacy FinTech applications.

[Paragraph 3. My key values and principles at work: what matters to me and what makes me efficient]
My principles at work focus on thinking about the results in advance, which leads to maintaining a focus on maintainability, scalability, and transparency in my code and everything I do. I'm a big fan of the layered architecture approach (DDD, Ports and Adapters, Clean Architecture) and prefer to start with "design on paper" and continue development only when all participants are on the same page. Of course, it’s much easier to say than to implement, but this is the vision of my ideal workflow. When I implement something, I always try to ask myself the reason behind the idea and how to make my work adaptable to changes.

[Paragraph 4. What I am great at: my skills]
Based on feedback from my customers and coworkers, I’m considered a strong problem solver, team leader, and researcher. Without exaggeration, I have sufficient experience with problem-solving, system design, and system architecture. With good experience in cloud computing, I know how to develop scalable applications and avoid well-known mistakes. I’m also good at detecting bottlenecks, maintaining, and integrating backend tasks in line with clean system architecture principles.

[Paragraph 5. My personality traits and how they influence my work outcomes]
My philosophy is to value time. Time is my main resource, and in order to treat it respectfully, I need to focus on self-improvement. To me, this means leading a healthy life, maintaining work-life balance, and understanding that just because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should. I like to ask myself uncomfortable questions, which is why I constantly challenge my ego and continuously learn. For instance, being a self-taught developer, I really value education, and I’m working to achieve a Master’s degree in Computer Science within the next couple of years.

[Paragraph 6. My personal growth and development]
As I mentioned before, I focus on consistent self-improvement in all layers, or rather, areas of my life. To me, the growth process looks like a sequence of small steps, and every skill can be improved if you do something consistently.
